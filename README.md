# Motion Detection using OpenCV with C++

The aim of the project is to observe the movements of the patient lying in the room. 
When an action is detected, an email is sent to the administrator. 
In this way, the necessary intervention to the patient is done quickly.

When motion is detected, video recording starts and is recorded until motion ends. This recorded video is also sent to the administrator.
